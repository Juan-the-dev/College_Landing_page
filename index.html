        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>Canton Commmunity College is a public community college with its main campus in Raymond, Mississippi, United States and branches in Jackson, Pearl, Utica, and Vicksburg. The Canton Community College District includes Hinds County, Claiborne County, part of Copiah County, Rankin County, and Warren County. With an enrollment of over 12,000 students at six campuses, it is the largest community college in Mississippi.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The college currently provides academic college-level courses for the first two years of four-year degree programs that must be completed at senior colleges or universities. It also provides two-year technical degree programs, post-secondary career (formerly called "vocational") programs, secondary (high-school) career education, and short-term training and continuing education.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>A community college is a type of undergraduate higher education institution, generally leading to an associate degree, certificate, or diploma. The term can have different meanings in different countries: many community colleges have an "open enrollment" for students who have graduated from high school (also known as senior secondary school or upper secondary school). The term usually refers to a higher educational institution that provides workforce education and college transfer academic programs. Some institutions maintain athletic teams and dormitories similar to their university counterparts.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>There are many paths that lead to a higher degree but going through a community college first will set you on the right one for many reasons. This in-depth guide will show you exactly how to plan for your higher education and save a lot of money on tuition while still getting a quality education.
            More than half of all American students start off with community college first and then move on to complete their bachelor’s or even their master’s degree. The reason for this is the great cost savings on tuition when you attend community college.
            When you couple that with the fact that community colleges now help you transfer your credits to 4-year universities, you will realize that you have a great way to start higher education. 
            This may all seem complicated but don’t worry though, in this guide we have you completely covered from the planning to the transfer stages and of course, everything in between. So let’s get started on taking the first step to your higher education.</p>
